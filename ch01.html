			<h1>Chapter 1. Introduction to Dynamic Web Content</h1>
			<p>The World Wide Web is a constantly evolving network that has already 
			traveled far beyond its conception in the early 1990s, when it was created 
			to solve a specific problem. State-of-the-art experiments at CERN (the 
			European Laboratory for Particle Physics, now best known as the operator 
			of the Large Hadron Collider) were producing incredible amounts of data—so 
			much that the data was proving unwieldy to distribute to the participating 
			scientists, who were spread out across the world.</p>
			<p>At this time, the internet was already in place, connecting several 
			hundred thousand computers, so Tim Berners-Lee (a CERN fellow) devised 
			a method of navigating between them using a hyperlinking framework, 
			which came to be known as Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. He also 
			created a markup language called Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML. 
			To bring these together, he wrote the first web browser and web server.</p>
			<div>
				<h1>The Advent of Web 1.0</h1>
				<p>Web 1.0 was only given its name when the term Web 2.0 was coined. 
				During the 1.0 era, most users were content consumers, and although 
				there were some personal web pages, there were no social networks. 
				Guestbooks were used instead of comment sections. Some sites have 
				already used databases but server resources and bandwidth were very 
				limited. Navigation and layout in Web 1.0 was managed with simple 
				buttons and graphics, while interaction was very limited.</p>
			</div>
			<p>Today we take these simple tools for granted, but back then, the 
			concept was revolutionary. The most connectivity so far experienced 
			by at-home modem users was dialing up and connecting to a bulletin board 
			where you could communicate and swap data only with other users of that 
			service. Consequently, you needed to be a member of many bulletin board 
			systems in order to effectively communicate electronically with your 
			colleagues and friends.</p>
			<p>But Berners-Lee changed all that in one fell swoop, and by the mid-1990s, 
			there were three major graphical web browsers competing for the attention 
			of five million users. It soon became obvious, though, that something 
			was missing. Yes, pages of text and graphics with hyperlinks to take 
			you to other pages was a brilliant concept, but the results didn’t reflect 
			the instantaneous potential of computers and the internet to meet the 
			particular needs of each user with dynamically changing content. Using 
			the web was a very dry and plain experience, even if we did now have 
			scrolling text and animated GIFs!</p>
			<p>Shopping carts, search engines, and social networks have clearly 
			altered how we use the web. In this chapter, we’ll take a brief look 
			at the various components that make up the web, and the software that 
			helps make using it a rich and dynamic experience.</p>
			<div class="note">
				<h4>Note</h4>
				<p>It is necessary to start using some acronyms more or less right 
				away. I have tried to clearly explain them before proceeding, but 
				don’t worry too much about what they stand for or what these names 
				mean, because the details will become clear as you read on.</p>

					<h1>HTTP and HTML: Berners-Lee’s Basics</h1>
					<p>HTTP is a communication standard governing the requests and 
					responses that are sent between the browser running on the end 
					user’s computer and the web server. The server’s job is to accept 
					a request from the client and attempt to reply to it in a meaningful 
					way, usually by serving up a requested web page—that’s why the 
					term <em>server</em> is used. The natural counterpart to a server 
					is a <em>client</em>, so that term is applied both to the web 
					browser and the computer on which it’s running.</p>
					<p>Between the client and the server there can be several other 
					devices, such as routers, proxies, gateways, and so on. They 
					serve different roles in ensuring that the requests and responses 
					are correctly transferred between the client and server. Typically, 
					they use the internet to send this information. Some of these 
					in-between devices can also help speed up the internet by storing 
					pages or information locally in what is called a <em>cache</em> 
					and then serving this content up to clients directly from the 
					cache rather than fetching it all the way from the source server.</p>
					<p>A web server can usually handle multiple simultaneous connections, 
					and when not communicating with a client, it spends its time 
					listening for an incoming connection. When one arrives, the 
					server sends back a response.</p>
				</div>
			</section>
			<section>
				<div id="requestsolidusresponse_procedure">
					<h1>The Request/Response Procedure</h1>
					<p>At its most basic level, the request/response process consists 
					of a web browser or other client asking the web server to send 
					it a web page and the server sending back the page. The browser 
					then takes care of displaying or rendering the page (see
					<a href="#basic_clientsolidusserver_requestsol">Figure 1-1</a>).</p>
					<figure>
						<div id="basic_clientsolidusserver_requestsol">
							<img alt="" height="539" src="images/lpm7_0101.png" width="600" />
							<h4>Figure 1-1. The basic client/server request/response 
							sequence</h4>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The steps in the request and response sequence are as follows:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
						<p>You enter <em>http://server.com</em> into your browser’s 
						address bar.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>Your browser looks up the Internet Protocol (IP) address 
						for <em>server.com</em>.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>Your browser issues a request for the home page at
						<em>server.com</em>.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The request crosses the internet and arrives at the
						<em>server.com</em> web server.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The web server, having received the request, looks for 
						the web page on its disk.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The web server retrieves the page and returns it to the 
						browser.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>Your browser displays the web page.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>For an average web page, this process also takes place once 
					for each object within the page such as a graphic, an embedded 
					video or a CSS stylesheet.</p>
					<p>In step 2, notice that the browser looks up the IP address 
					of <em>server.com</em>. Every machine attached to the internet 
					has an IP address—your computer included—but we generally access 
					web servers by name, such as <em>google.com</em>. The browser 
					consults an additional internet service called the Domain Name 
					System (DNS) to find the server’s associated IP address and 
					then uses it to communicate with the computer.</p>
					<p>For dynamic web pages, the procedure is a little more involved, 
					because it may bring both PHP and MySQL into the mix. For instance, 
					you may click a picture of a raincoat. Then PHP will put together 
					a request using the standard database language, SQL—many of 
					whose commands you will learn in this book—and send the request 
					to the MySQL server. The MySQL server will return information 
					about the raincoat you selected, and the PHP code will wrap 
					it all up in some HTML, which the server will send to your browser 
					(see <a href="#dynamic_clientsolidusserver_requestsol">Figure 
					1-2</a>).</p>
					<figure>

							<img alt="" height="594" src="images/lpm7_0102.png" width="600" />
							<h4>Figure 1-2. A dynamic client/server request/response 
							sequence</h4>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The steps are as follows:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
						<p>You enter <em>http://server.com </em>into your browser’s 
						address bar.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>Your browser looks up the IP address for <em>server.com</em>.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>Your browser issues a request to that address for the 
						web server’s home page.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The request crosses the internet and arrives at the
						<em>server.com</em> web server.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The web server, having received the request, fetches 
						the home page from its hard disk.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>With the home page now in memory, the web server notices 
						that it is a file incorporating PHP scripting and passes 
						the page to the PHP interpreter.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The PHP interpreter executes the PHP code.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>Some of the PHP contains SQL statements, which the PHP 
						interpreter now passes to the MySQL database engine.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The MySQL database returns the results of the statements 
						to the PHP interpreter.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The PHP interpreter returns the results of the executed 
						PHP code, along with the results from the MySQL database, 
						to the web server.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The web server returns the page to the requesting client, 
						which displays it.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Although it’s helpful to be aware of this process so that 
					you know how the three elements work together, in practice you 
					don’t really need to concern yourself with these details, because 
					they all happen automatically.</p>
					<p>The HTML pages returned to the browser in each example may 
					well contain JavaScript, which will be interpreted locally by 
					the client, and which could initiate another request.</p>

					<h1>The Benefits of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML</h1>
					<p>At the start of this chapter, I introduced the world of Web 
					1.0, but it wasn’t long before the rush was on to create Web 
					1.1, with the development of such browser enhancements as Java, 
					JavaScript, Flash, and ActiveX. On the server side, progress 
					was being made on the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) using scripting 
					languages such as Perl (an alternative to the PHP language) 
					and <em>server-side scripting</em>—inserting the contents of 
					one file (or the output of running a local program) into another 
					one dynamically.</p>
					<p>Once the dust had settled, three main technologies stood 
					head and shoulders above the others. Although Perl was still 
					a popular scripting language with a strong following, PHP’s 
					simplicity and built-in links to the MySQL database program 
					had earned it more than double the number of users. And JavaScript, 
					which had become an essential part of the equation for dynamically 
					manipulating HTML, now took on the even more muscular task of 
					handling the client side of asynchronous communication (exchanging 
					data between a client and server after a web page has loaded). 
					Using asynchronous communication, web pages perform data handling 
					and send requests to web servers in the background—without the 
					web user being aware that this is going on.</p>
					<p>No doubt the symbiotic nature and the open source licenses 
					of PHP and MySQL helped propel them both forward, but what attracted 
					developers to them in the first place? The simple answer has 
					to be the ease with which you can use them to quickly create 
					dynamic elements on websites. MySQL is a fast and powerful yet 
					easy-to-use database system that offers just about anything 
					a website would need in order to find and serve up data to browsers.</p>
					<p>And when you bring JavaScript and CSS into the mix too, you 
					have a recipe for building highly dynamic and interactive websites—especially 
					as there is now a wide range of sophisticated frameworks of 
					JavaScript functions you can call on to really speed up web 
					development. These include the well-known jQuery, which until 
					recently was one of the most common ways programmers accessed 
					asynchronous communication features</p>
					<p>The more recent React JavaScript library has also been growing 
					quickly in popularity, and is now one of the most widely downloaded 
					and implemented frameworks, so much so that at the time of writing 
					the Indeed job site lists many more positions for React developers 
					than for jQuery.</p>
					<p>React provides state-of-the-art functionality for building 
					complex UI interactions that communicate with the server in 
					real time with JavaScript-driven pages. It let’s you create 
					components which are the building blocks of the React application.</p>
					<p>A
					<a href="https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
					React component</a> can be anything in your web application. 
					It can be as simple as a Button, Text, Label, or Grid, or even 
					as complex as a Login widget or a popup modal with control buttons. 
					React also supports server rendering of its components using 
					tools like
					<a href="https://nextjs.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
					Next.js</a>. You can even use React in your existing apps too 
					(it was designed with this in mind). You can change a small 
					part of your existing application by using React, and if that 
					change works, then you can start converting your whole application 
					over to React.js. However, other frameworks such as Vue.js may 
					be more suitable for this sort of iterative implementation.</p>

							<h2>MariaDB: The MySQL Clone</h2>
							<p>After Oracle (the database management corporation) 
							purchased Sun Microsystems (the owners of MySQL), the 
							community became wary that MySQL might not remain fully 
							open source, so MariaDB was forked from it to keep it 
							free under the GNU GPL, the software license that guarantees 
							users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the 
							software. Development of MariaDB is led by some of the 
							original developers of MySQL, and it retains exceedingly 
							close compatibility with MySQL. Therefore, you may well 
							encounter MariaDB on some servers in place of MySQL—but 
							not to worry, everything in this book works equally 
							well on both MySQL and MariaDB. For all intents and 
							purposes, you can swap one with the other and notice 
							no difference.</p>
							<p>And anyway, as it turns out, many of the initial 
							fears appear to have been allayed as MySQL remains open 
							source, with Oracle simply charging for support and 
							for editions that provide additional features such as 
							geo-replication and automatic scaling. However, unlike 
							MariaDB, MySQL is no longer community driven, so knowing 
							that MariaDB will always be there if ever needed will 
							keep many developers sleeping at night and probably 
							ensures that MySQL itself will remain open source.</p>

					<section>
						<div id="using_php">
							<h2>Using PHP</h2>
							<p>With PHP, it’s a simple matter to embed dynamic activity 
							in web pages. When you give pages the <em>.php</em> 
							extension, they have instant access to the scripting 
							language. From a developer’s point of view, all you 
							have to do is write code such as the following:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<code>&lt;?php</code>
  <code>echo</code> <code>"Today is "</code> <code>.</code> <code>date("l")</code> <code>.</code> <code>". ";</code>
<code>?&gt;</code>

<code>Here's the latest news.</code></pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>The opening <code>&lt;?php</code> tells the web server 
							to allow the PHP program to interpret all the following 
							code up to the <code>?&gt;</code> tag. Outside of this 
							construct, everything is sent to the client as direct 
							HTML. So, the text <code>Here's the latest news.</code> 
							is simply output to the browser; within the PHP tags, 
							the built-in <code>date</code> function displays the 
							current day of the week according to the server’s system 
							time.</p>
							<p>The final output of the two parts looks like this:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<strong>Today is Wednesday. Here's the latest news.</strong></pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>PHP is a flexible language, and some people prefer 
							to place the PHP construct directly next to PHP code, 
							like this:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<code>Today</code> <code>is</code> <code>&lt;?php</code> <code>echo</code> <code>date("l");</code> <code>?&gt;. Here's the latest news.</code></pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>There are even more ways of formatting and outputting 
							information, which I’ll explain in the chapters on PHP. 
							The point is that with PHP, web developers have a scripting 
							language that, although not as fast as compiling your 
							code in C or a similar language, is incredibly speedy 
							and also integrates seamlessly with HTML markup.</p>
							<div class="note">
								<h4>Note</h4>
								<p>If you intend to enter the PHP examples in this 
								book into a program editor to follow along with 
								me, you must remember to add <code>&lt;?php</code> 
								in front and <code>?&gt;</code> after them to ensure 
								that the PHP interpreter processes them. To facilitate 
								this, you may wish to prepare a file called <em>
								example.php</em> with those tags in place.</p>
							</div>
							<p>Using PHP, you have unlimited control over your web 
							server. Whether you need to modify HTML on the fly, 
							process a credit card, add user details to a database, 
							or fetch information from a third-party website, you 
							can do it all from within the same PHP files in which 
							the HTML itself resides.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div id="using_mysql">
							<h2>Using MySQL</h2>
							<p>Of course, there’s not a lot of point to being able 
							to change HTML output dynamically unless you also have 
							a means to track the information users provide to your 
							website as they use it. In the early days of the web, 
							many sites used “flat” text files to store data such 
							as usernames and passwords. But this approach could 
							cause problems if the file wasn’t correctly locked against 
							corruption from multiple simultaneous accesses. Also, 
							a flat file can get only so big before it becomes unwieldy 
							to manage—not to mention the difficulty of trying to 
							merge files and perform complex searches in any kind 
							of reasonable time.</p>
							<p>That’s where relational databases with structured 
							querying become essential. And MySQL, being free to 
							use and installed on vast numbers of internet web servers, 
							rises superbly to the occasion. It is a robust and exceptionally 
							fast database management system that uses English-like 
							commands.</p>
							<p>The highest level of MySQL structure is a database, 
							within which you can have one or more tables that contain 
							your data. This is similar to let’s say an Excel spreadsheet 
							file which consists of multiple sheets: the spreadsheet 
							file can be viewed as a database, and the individual 
							sheets as tables.</p>
							<p>Let’s suppose you are working on a table called
							<em>users</em>, within which you have created columns 
							for <em>surname</em>, <em>firstname</em>, and <em>email</em>, 
							and you now wish to add another user. One command that 
							you might use to do this is as follows:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<code>INSERT</code> <code>INTO</code> <code>users</code> <code>VALUES('Smith',</code> <code>'John',</code> <code>'jsmith@mysite.com');</code></pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>You will previously have issued other commands to 
							create the database and table and to set up all the 
							correct fields, but the SQL <code>INSERT</code> command 
							here shows how simple it can be to add new data to a 
							database.</p>
							<p>It’s equally easy to look up data. Let’s assume that 
							you have an email address for a user and need to look 
							up that person’s name. To do this, you could issue a 
							MySQL query such as the following:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<code>SELECT</code> <code>surname,firstname</code> <code>FROM</code> <code>users</code> <code>WHERE</code> <code>email='jsmith@mysite.com';</code></pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>MySQL will then return <code>Smith, John</code> and 
							any other pairs of names that may be associated with 
							that email address in the database.</p>
							<p>As you’d expect, there’s quite a bit more that you 
							can do with MySQL than just simple <code>INSERT</code> 
							and <code>SELECT</code> commands. For example, you can 
							combine related data sets to bring related pieces of 
							information together, ask for results in a variety of 
							orders, make partial matches when you know only part 
							of the string that you are searching for, return only 
							the <em>n</em>th result, and a lot more.</p>
							<p>Using PHP, you can make all these calls directly 
							to MySQL without having to directly access the MySQL 
							command-line interface yourself. This means you can 
							save the results in arrays for processing and perform 
							multiple lookups, each dependent on the results returned 
							from earlier ones, to drill down to the item of data 
							you need.</p>
							<p>For even more power, as you’ll see later, there are 
							additional functions built right into MySQL that you 
							can call up to efficiently run common operations within 
							MySQL, rather than creating them out of multiple PHP 
							calls to MySQL.</p>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div id="using_javascript">
							<h2>Using JavaScript</h2>
							<p>JavaScript was created to enable scripting access 
							to all the elements of an HTML document. In other words, 
							it provides a means for dynamic user interaction such 
							as checking email address validity in input forms and 
							displaying prompts such as “Did you really mean that?” 
							(although it cannot be relied upon for security, which 
							should always be performed on the web server).</p>
							<p>Combined with CSS (see the following section), JavaScript 
							is the power behind dynamic web pages that change in 
							front of your eyes rather than when a new page is returned 
							by the server.</p>
							<p>However, JavaScript used to be tricky to use, due 
							to both the way the language was initially designed 
							and to some major differences in the ways different 
							browsers have chosen to implement it. This mainly came 
							about when some manufacturers tried to put additional 
							functionality into their browsers at the expense of 
							compatibility with their rivals.</p>
							<p>Thankfully, the language evolves and the browser 
							developers have mostly come to their senses and have 
							realized the need for full compatibility with one another, 
							so it is less necessary these days to have to optimize 
							your code for different browsers.</p>
							<p>For now, let’s take a look at how to use basic JavaScript, 
							accepted by all browsers:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code>
  <code>document.write("Today is "</code> <code>+</code> <code>Date()</code> <code>);</code>
<code>&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>This code snippet tells the web browser to interpret 
							everything within the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags 
							as JavaScript, which the browser does by writing the 
							text <code>Today is</code> to the current document, 
							along with the date, using the JavaScript function
							<code>Date</code>. The result will look something like 
							this:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<strong>Today is Wed Jan 01 2025 01:23:45</strong>
</pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div>
								<h1>Walking Before Running</h1>
								<p>The <code>document.write</code> function is deliberately 
								being used here in the way in which it was originally 
								intended, for the sake of simplicity in very small 
								code snippets. However, there are better ways to 
								write into web pages, and also for issuing feedback 
								while debugging, all of which will be revealed at 
								the right times in this book, as well as explanations 
								for when and why the other options will work better 
								for you.</p>
							</div>
							<p>As previously mentioned, JavaScript was originally 
							developed to offer dynamic control over the various 
							elements within an HTML document, and that is still 
							its main use. But more and more, JavaScript is being 
							used as the primary language for web application development, 
							with features such as <em>Ajax</em>, the process of 
							accessing the web server in the background.</p>
							<p>Asynchronous communication is what allows web pages 
							to begin to resemble standalone programs, because they 
							don’t have to be reloaded in their entirety to display 
							new content. Instead, an asynchronous call can pull 
							in and update a single element on a web page, such as 
							changing your photograph on a social networking site 
							or replacing a button that you click with the answer 
							to a question. This subject is fully covered in
							<a href="ch17.html#using_ajax">Chapter 17</a>.</p>

							<h2>Using CSS</h2>
							<p>CSS is the crucial companion to HTML, ensuring that 
							the HTML text and embedded images are laid out consistently 
							and in a manner appropriate for the user’s screen. With 
							the emergence of the CSS3 standard in recent years, 
							CSS now offers a level of dynamic interactivity previously 
							supported only by JavaScript. For example, not only 
							can you style any HTML element to change its dimensions, 
							colors, borders, spacing, and so on, but now you can 
							also add animated transitions and transformations to 
							your web pages, using only a few lines of CSS.</p>
							<p>By the way, the numbering standard for CSS releases 
							(such as CSS2 or CSS3) has now been dropped, so Cascading 
							Style Sheets are now referred to as simply CSS, but 
							various submodules have their own numbering such as 
							CSS Selectors Level 4 and CSS Images Level 3.</p>
							<p>Using CSS can be as simple as inserting a few rules 
							between <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/style&gt;</code> 
							tags in the head of a web page, like this:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<code>&lt;style&gt;</code>
  <code>p</code> <code>{</code>
    <code>text-align:justify;</code>
    <code>font-family:Helvetica;</code>
  <code>}</code>
<code>&lt;/style&gt;</code></pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>These rules change the default text alignment of 
							the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag so that paragraphs contained 
							in it are justified, the content exactly fills the box, 
							and use the Helvetica font.</p>
							<p>There are many different ways you can lay out CSS 
							rules discussed in the supplementary chapter, <i>Introduction 
							to CSS</i>, and you can also include them directly within 
							tags or save a set of rules to an external file to be 
							loaded in separately. This flexibility not only lets 
							you style your HTML precisely but can also (for example) 
							provide built-in hover functionality to animate objects 
							as the mouse passes over them. You will also learn how 
							to access all of an element’s CSS properties from JavaScript 
							as well as HTML.</p>
							<p>In the main body of the book you’ll also learn all

					<h1>And Then There’s HTML5</h1>
					<p>As useful as all these additions to the web standards became, 
					they were not enough for ever-more ambitious developers. For 
					example, there was still no simple way to manipulate graphics 
					in a web browser without resorting to plug-ins such as Flash 
					(which is now no-longer supported or widely used). And the same 
					went for inserting audio and video into web pages. Plus, several 
					annoying inconsistencies had crept into HTML during its evolution.</p>
					<p>So, to clear all this up and take the internet beyond Web 
					2.0 and into its next iteration, a new standard for HTML was 
					created to address all these shortcomings: <em>HTML5</em>. Its 
					development began as long ago as 2004, when the first draft 
					was drawn up by the Mozilla Foundation and Opera Software, developers 
					of two popular web browsers. Today, the HTML5 standard is maintained 
					by WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) 
					and is officially called HTML Living Standard.</p>
					<p>It’s a never-ending cycle of development, though, and more 
					functionality is sure to be built into it over time. Some of 
					the best features in HTML5 for handling and displaying media 
					include the <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, 
					and <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code> elements, which add sound, video, 
					and advanced graphics. Everything you need to know about these 
					and all other aspects of HTML5 is covered in detail starting 
					in the supplemental PDF chapter, <em>Introduction to HTML5</em>, 
					available in the book’s
					<a href="https://github.com/RobinNixon/lpmj7" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
					GitHub repository</a>.</p>
					<div class="note">
						<h4>Note</h4>
						<p>One of the little things I like about the HTML5 specification 
						is that XHTML syntax is no longer required for self-closing 
						elements. In the past, you could display a line break using 
						the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element. Then, to ensure future 
						compatibility with XHTML (the planned replacement for HTML 
						that never happened), this was changed to <code>&lt;br</code>
						<code>/&gt;</code>, in which a closing <code>/</code> character 
						was added (since all elements were expected to include a 
						closing tag featuring this character). But now things have 
						gone full circle, and you can use either version of these 
						types of elements. In this book I have reverted to the former 
						style of <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, 
						and so on, as this is also what the HTML standard now recommends. 
						Do note, however, that frameworks such as React use an extension 
						to JavaScript called JSX, which <em>does</em> require the 
						preceding <code>/</code> character, and where such examples 
						occur in this book, the preceding <code>/</code> is therefore 
						used.</p>

					<h1>The Apache Web Server</h1>
					<p>In addition to PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, there’s 
					a sixth hero in the dynamic web: the web server. In the case 
					of this book, that means the Apache web server. We’ve discussed 
					a little of what a web server does during the HTTP server/client 
					exchange, but it does much more behind the scenes.</p>
					<p>For example, Apache doesn’t serve up just HTML files—it handles 
					a wide range of files, from images to MP3 audio files, RSS (Really 
					Simple Syndication) feeds, and so on. And these objects don’t 
					have to be static files such as GIF images. They can all be 
					generated by programs such as PHP scripts. That’s right: PHP 
					can even create images and other files for you, either on the 
					fly or in advance to serve up later.</p>
					<p>To do this, you normally have modules either pre-compiled 
					into Apache or PHP or called up at runtime. One such module 
					is the GD (Graphics Draw) library, which PHP uses to create 
					and handle graphics.</p>
					<p>Apache also supports a huge range of modules of its own. 
					In addition to the PHP module, the most important for your purposes 
					as a web programmer are the modules that handle security. Other 
					examples are the Rewrite module, which enables the web server 
					to handle a range of URL types and rewrite them to its own internal 
					requirements, and the Proxy module, which you can use to serve 
					up often-requested pages from a cache to ease the load on the 
					server.</p>
					<p>Later in the book, you’ll see how to use some of these modules 
					to enhance the features provided by the three core technologies.</p>

					<h1>Node.js: An Alternative to Apache</h1>
					<p>In 2009 developer Ryan Dahl was dissatisfied with Apache 
					and its difficulties with handling large numbers of concurrent 
					connections, and came up with asolution he called Node.js, which 
					uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine to allow developers to use 
					JavaScript for server-side scripting. Shortly afterwards, a 
					package manager was introduced for the Node.js environment called
					<strong>npm</strong>, which made it easier for programmers to 
					publish and share source code of Node.js packages, simplifying 
					installation, updating, and uninstallation of packages.</p>
					<p>As of 2024 Node.js has reached version 22.6.0 and has become 
					a fully mainstream alternative to the Apache web server. This 
					new edition of the book would have been remiss to not detail 
					its benefits, and provide enough information to get you up and 
					running with it, if you should so choose. Here are some of the 
					main reasons you might make that choice:</p>
					<p>Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, allowing 
					it to handle a large number of concurrent connections efficiently. 
					This non-blocking nature enables scalable and high-performance 
					applications, making it ideal for building real-time web applications, 
					chat applications, and streaming services, for example.</p>
					<p>It allows developers to use JavaScript on both the front-end 
					and back-end, making it a full-stack development environment. 
					This eliminates the need to switch between different programming 
					languages, enabling better code reusability, and streamlining 
					the development process. Yes, that means you won’t have to keep 
					up-to-date with PHP if you make the switch, and indeed Node.js 
					will not be able to run your PHP scripts. However, a rather 
					complex app can still use both Node.js and Apache with PHP each 
					for different parts or tasks.</p>
					<p>Being built on the V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js provides 
					exceptional performance, executing JavaScript code quickly and 
					efficiently, resulting in faster response times and improved 
					overall application performance. Additionally, Node.js has a 
					small memory footprint, making it resource-efficient and suitable 
					for deploying on cloud platforms.</p>
					<p>As you will learn, there are many other solid reasons for 
					using Node.js, but just these few are already highly persuasive. 
					PHP remains a very important language prevalent across the Internet, 
					is actively developed, has active communities and is often used 
					together with other languages and environments such as Node.js.</p>

				<div id="about_open_source">
					<h1>About Open Source</h1>
					<p>The technologies in this book are open source: anyone is 
					allowed to read and change the code. Whether or not this status 
					is the reason these technologies are so popular has often been 
					debated, but PHP, MySQL, and Apache <em>are</em> the three most 
					commonly used tools in their categories. What can be said definitively, 
					though, is that their being open source means that they have 
					been developed in the community by teams of programmers writing 
					the features they themselves want and need, with the original 
					code available for all to see and change. Bugs can be found 
					quickly, and security breaches can be prevented before they 
					happen.</p>
					<p>There’s another benefit: all of these programs are usually 
					free to use, although it depends in the particular license. 
					There’s no worrying about having to purchase additional licenses 
					if you have to scale up your website and add more servers, and 
					you don’t need to check the budget before deciding whether to 
					upgrade to the latest versions of these products.</p>

				<div id="bringing_it_all_together">
					<h1>Bringing It All Together</h1>
					<p>The real beauty of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML 
					is the wonderful way in which they all work together to produce 
					dynamic web content: PHP handles all the main work on the web 
					server, MySQL manages all the data, and the combination of CSS 
					and JavaScript looks after web page presentation. JavaScript 
					can also talk with your PHP code on the web server whenever 
					it needs to update something (either on the server or on the 
					web page). And with the powerful features in HTML, such as the 
					canvas, audio and video, and geolocation, you can make your 
					web pages highly dynamic, interactive, and multimedia-packed.</p>
					<p>Without using program code, let’s summarize the contents 
					of this chapter by looking at the process of combining some 
					of these technologies into an everyday asynchronous communication 
					feature that many websites use: checking whether a desired username 
					already exists on the site when a user is signing up for a new 
					account. A good example of this can be seen with Gmail (see
					<a href="#gmail-signup">Figure 1-3</a>).</p>
					<figure>
						<div id="gmail-signup">
							<img alt="" height="668" src="images/lpm7_0103.png" width="600" />
							<h4>Figure 1-3. Gmail uses asynchronous communication 
							to check the availability of usernames</h4>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The steps involved in this asynchronous process will be similar 
					to the following:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
						<p>The server outputs the HTML to create the web form, which 
						asks for the necessary details, such as username, first 
						name, last name, and email address.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>At the same time, the server attaches some JavaScript 
						to the HTML to monitor the username input box and check 
						for two things: whether some text has been typed into it, 
						and whether the input has been deselected because the user 
						has clicked another input box or tabbed away.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>Once the text has been entered and the field deselected, 
						in the background the JavaScript code passes the username 
						that was entered back to a software on the web server and 
						awaits a response.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The web server looks up the username and replies back 
						to the JavaScript regarding whether that name has already 
						been taken.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>The JavaScript then places an indication next to the 
						username input box to show whether the name is available 
						to the user—perhaps a green checkmark or a red cross graphic, 
						along with some text.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>If the username is not available and the user still submits 
						the form, the JavaScript interrupts the submission and re-emphasizes 
						(perhaps with a larger graphic and/or an alert box) that 
						the user needs to choose another username.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
						<p>Optionally, an improved version of this process could 
						even look at the username requested by the user and suggest 
						an alternative that is currently available.</p>
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p>All of this takes place quietly in the background and makes 
					for a comfortable and seamless user experience. Without asynchronous 
					communication, the entire form would have to be submitted to 
					the server, which would then send back HTML, highlighting any 
					mistakes. It would be a workable solution but nowhere near as 
					tidy or pleasurable as on-the-fly form field processing.</p>
					<p>Asynchronous communication can be used for a lot more than 
					simple input verification and processing, though; we’ll explore 
					many additional things that you can do with it later in this 
					book.</p>
					<p>In this chapter, you have read a good introduction to the 
					core technologies of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML (as 
					well as Apache) and have learned how they work together. In
					<a href="ch02.html#setting_up_a_development_server">Chapter 
					2</a>, we’ll look at how you can install your own web development 
					server on which to practice everything that you will be learning.</p>
					<p>Now, as in all this book’s chapters, I recommend you see 
					whether you can answer the following questions to check that 
					you have absorbed its contents.</p>
