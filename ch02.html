			<h1>Chapter 2. Setting Up a Development Server</h1>
			<p>If you wish to develop internet applications but don’t have your 
			own development server, you will have to upload every modification you 
			make to a server somewhere else on the web before you can test it.</p>
			<p>Even on a fast broadband connection, this can still represent a significant 
			slowdown in development time. On a local computer, however, testing 
			can be as easy as saving an update (usually just a matter of clicking 
			once on an icon) and then hitting the Refresh button in your browser.</p>
			<p>Another advantage of a development server is that you don’t have 
			to worry about embarrassing errors or security problems while you’re 
			writing and testing, whereas you need to be aware of what people may 
			see or do with your application when it’s on a public website. It’s 
			best to iron everything out while you’re still on a home or small office 
			system, presumably protected by firewalls and other safeguards.</p>
			<p>Once you have your own development server, you’ll wonder how you 
			ever managed without one, and it’s easy to set one up. Just follow the 
			steps in the following sections, using the appropriate instructions 
			for a PC, a Mac, or a Linux system.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we cover just the server side of the web experience, 
			as described in
			<a href="ch01.html#introduction_to_dynamic_web_content">Chapter 1</a>. 
			But to test the results of your work—particularly when we start using 
			JavaScript, CSS, and HTML later in this book—you should ideally have 
			an instance of every major web browser running on some system convenient 
			to you. Sometimes, testing on two different browsers may be sufficient 
			but whenever possible, the list of browsers should include at least 
			Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome.</p>
			<p>Even though there are multiple other browsers based on Google Chromium 
			browser there may still be minor differences in their implementation 
			that make it worthwhile testing your code on all possible browsers before 
			final release. You may need all these once you have a product ready 
			to release, just to ensure everything runs as expected on all browsers 
			and platforms.</p>
			<p>If you plan to ensure that your sites look good on mobile devices 
			too, you should try to arrange access to a wide range of iOS and Android 
			devices and services like BrowserStack will help here. Browser developer 
			tools also offer mobile device emulation to help you verify the site 
			is responsive and viewable on those smaller screens.</p>

					<h1>What Is a WAMP, MAMP, or LAMP?</h1>
					<p>WAMP, MAMP, and LAMP are abbreviations for “Windows, Apache, 
					MySQL, and PHP,” “Mac, Apache, MySQL, and PHP,” and “Linux, 
					Apache, MySQL, and PHP.” These abbreviations each describe a 
					fully functioning setup used for developing dynamic internet 
					web pages.</p>
					<p>WAMPs, MAMPs, and LAMPs come in the form of packages that 
					bind the bundled programs together so that you don’t have to 
					install and set them up separately. This means you can simply 
					download and install a single program and follow a few easy 
					prompts to get your web development server up and running fast, 
					with minimal hassle.</p>
					<p>During installation, several default settings are created 
					for you. The security configurations of such an installation 
					will not be as tight as on a production web server, because 
					it is optimized for local use. For these reasons, you should 
					never install such a setup as a production server.</p>
					<p>However, for developing and testing websites and applications, 
					one of these installations should be entirely sufficient.</p>
					<div class="warning">
						<h4>Warning</h4>
						<p>If you choose not to go the WAMP/MAMP/LAMP route for 
						building your own development system, you should know that 
						downloading and integrating the various parts yourself can 
						be very time-consuming and may require a lot of research 
						in order to configure everything fully. But if you already 
						have all the components installed and integrated with one 
						another, they should work with the examples in this book.</p>
					</div>

				<div id="installing_xampp_on_windows">
					<h1>Installing AMPPS on Windows</h1>
					<p>There are several available WAMP servers, each offering slightly 
					different configurations. Different editions of this book have 
					recommended different WAMP products according to which seems 
					to offer the best features and appears the most reliable at 
					the time. Currently AMPPS looks like the best option (although 
					you could choose other alternatives if you preferred and still 
					be able to follow through the examples in this book). You can 
					download AMPPS by clicking the download button on the website’s
					<a href="http://ampps.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
					home page</a>. (There are also Mac and Linux versions available; 
					see <a href="#installing_xampp_on_mac_os_x">“Installing AMPPS 
					on macOS”</a> and <a href="#installing_a_lamp_on_linux">“Installing 
					a LAMP on Linux”</a>.)</p>
					<p>I recommend that you always download the latest stable release 
					(as I write this, it’s 4.4, the installer for which is about 
					46 MB in size). The various Windows, macOS, and Linux installers 
					are listed on the download page.</p>
					<p>Once you’ve downloaded the installer, run it to bring up 
					the window shown in <a href="#the-opening-window-of">Figure 
					2-1</a>. Before arriving at that window, though, if you use 
					an antivirus program or have User Account Control activated 
					on Windows, you may first be shown one or more advisory notices, 
					and will have to click Yes and/or OK to continue with the installation.</p>
					<p>Click Next, after which you must accept the agreement. Click 
					Next once again, and then once more to move past the information 
					screen. You will now need to confirm the installation location. 
					This will probably be suggested as something like the following, 
					depending on the letter of your main hard drive, but you can 
					change this if you wish:</p>
					<div>
						<pre>
C:\Program Files\Ampps</pre>
						<div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<figure>
						<div id="the-opening-window-of">

					</figure>
					<div class="note">
						<h4>Note</h4>
						<p>During the lifetime of this edition, some of the screens 
						and options shown in the following walk-through may change. 
						If so, just use your common sense to proceed in as similar 
						a manner as possible to the sequence of actions described.</p>
					</div>
					<p>Then you must accept the agreements in the following screen 
					and click Next, then after reading the information summary click 
					Next once more and you will be asked which folder you wish to 
					install AMPPS into.</p>
					<p>Once you have decided where to install AMPPS, click Next, 
					decide where shortcuts should be saved (the default shown is 
					usually just fine), and click Next again to choose which icons 
					you wish to install, as shown in <a href="#ampps-icons">Figure 
					2-2</a>. On the screen that follows, click the Install button 
					to start the process.</p>
					<figure>
						<div id="ampps-icons">
							<img alt="" height="457" src="images//lpm7_0202.png" width="600" />
							<h4>Figure 2-2. Choose which icons to install</h4>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>Installation will take a few minutes, after which you should 
					see the completion screen in <a href="#ampps-complete">Figure 
					2-3</a>, and you can click Finish.</p>
					<figure>
						<div id="ampps-complete">
							<img alt="" height="458" src="images//lpm7_0203.png" width="600" />
							<h4>Figure 2-3. AMPPS is now installed</h4>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>The final thing you must do is install Microsoft Visual C++ 
					Redistributable, if you haven’t already. A window will pop up 
					to prompt you, as shown in
					<a href="#install-visual-c-redist">Figure 2-4</a>. Click Install 
					to start the installation and if you already have it you will 
					be told whether you need to reinstall it, which you can skip.</p>
					<figure>
						<div id="install-visual-c-redist">
							<img alt="" height="371" src="images//lpm7_0204.png" width="600" />
							<h4>Figure 2-4. Install the Visual C++ redistributable 
							if you don’t already have it</h4>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>If you choose to go ahead and install, you will have to agree 
					to the terms and conditions in the pop-up window that appears 
					and then click Install. Installation of this should be fairly 
					fast. Click Close to finish.</p>
					<p>Once AMPPS is installed, the control window shown in
					<a href="#the-ampps-control-win">Figure 2-5</a> should appear 
					at the bottom right of your desktop. You can also call up this 
					window using the AMPPS application shortcut in the Start menu 
					or on the desktop, if you allowed these icons to be created.</p>
					<p>Before proceeding, if you have any further questions, I recommend 
					you acquaint yourself with the
					<a href="https://ampps.com/docs/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
					AMPPS documentation</a>, otherwise you are set to go—there’s 
					always a Support link at the bottom of the control window that 
					will take you to the AMPPS website, where you can open up a 
					trouble ticket should you need to.</p>

							<h4>Figure 2-5. The AMPPS control window</h4>
						</div>
					</figure>
					<p>You may notice that the default version of PHP in AMPPS is 
					8.2. If you wish to try other versions for any reason, click 
					the Options button (nine white boxes in a square) within the 
					AMPPS control window and then select Change PHP Version, whereupon 
					a new menu will appear from which you can choose to install 
					a different version.</p>
					<section>
						<div id="testing_the_installation">
							<h2>Testing the Installation</h2>
							<p>The first thing to do at this point is verify that 
							everything is working correctly. To do this, enter the 
							following URL into the address bar of your browser:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
http://localhost
</pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>This will call up an introductory screen, where you 
							will have the opportunity to secure AMPPS by giving 
							it a password (see <a href="#the-initial-security">Figure 
							2-6</a>). It is up to you now as to whether or not to 
							secure the program. If only you will have access to 
							the PC you may choose not to. But if there could be 
							any security implications then you probably should password 
							protect the installation.</p>
							<figure>
								<div id="the-initial-security">
									<img alt="" height="419" src="images//lpm7_0206.png" width="600" />
									<h4>Figure 2-6. The initial security setup screen</h4>
								</div>
							</figure>
							<p>Once this has been done you will be taken to the 
							main control page at <em>http://localhost/ampps/</em>. 
							From here you can configure and control all aspects 
							of the AMPPS stack, so make a note of this for future 
							reference, or perhaps set a bookmark in your browser.</p>
							<p>Next, type the following to view the document root 
							(described in the following section) of your new Apache 
							web server:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
http://localhost</pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>This time, rather than seeing the initial screen 
							about setting up security, you should see something 
							similar to <a href="#viewing-the-document">Figure 2-7</a>, 
							although the files shown may be different.</p>
							<figure>
								<div id="viewing-the-document">
									<img alt="" height="440" src="images//lpm7_0207.png" width="600" />
									<h4>Figure 2-7. Viewing the document root</h4>
								</div>
							</figure>
						</div>
					</section>
					<section>
						<div id="accessing_the_document_root">
							<h2>Accessing the Document Root (Windows)</h2>
							<p>The <em>document root</em> is the directory that 
							contains the main web documents for a domain. This directory 
							is the one that the server uses when a basic URL without 
							a path is typed into a browser, such as <em>http://yahoo.com</em> 
							or, for your local server, <em>http://localhost.</em></p>
							<p>By default AMPPS will use the following location 
							as the document root:</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<strong>C:\Program Files\Ampps\www</strong></pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>To ensure that you have everything correctly configured, 
							you should now create the obligatory “Hello World” file. 
							So, create a small HTML file along the following lines 
							using a plain text editor such as Windows Notepad (which 
							will work just fine, although better suited applications 
							called Code Editors are discussed later in this chapter):</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;html</code> <code>lang="en"&gt;</code>
  <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>
    <code>&lt;title&gt;</code>A quick test<code>&lt;/title&gt;</code>
  <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code>
  <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
    Hello World!
  <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code>
<code>&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>Once you have typed this, save the file into the 
							document root directory, using the filename <em>test.html</em>..</p>
							<p>You can now call this page up in your browser by 
							entering the following URL in its address bar (see
							<a href="#your-first-web-page">Figure 2-8</a>):</p>
							<div>
								<pre>
http://localhost/test.html</pre>
								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<figure>
								<div id="your-first-web-page">
									<img alt="" height="250" src="images//lpm7_0208.png" width="600" />
									<h4>Figure 2-8. Your first web page</h4>
								</div>
							</figure>
							<p>Remember that serving a web page from the document 
							root (or a subfolder) is different from loading one 
							into a web browser from your computer’s filesystem. 
							The former will ensure access to PHP, MySQL, and all 
							the features of a web server, while the latter will 
							simply load the file into the browser, which will do 
							its best to display it but will be unable to process 
							any PHP or other server instructions. So, you should 
							generally run examples using the <em>localhost</em> 
							preface from your browser’s address bar, unless you 
							are certain that the file doesn’t rely on web server 
							functionality.</p>

					<section>
						<div id="alternative_wamps">
							<h2>Alternative WAMPs</h2>
							<p>When software is updated, it sometimes works differently 
							from how you expect, and bugs can even be introduced. 
							So, if you encounter difficulties that you cannot resolve 
							in AMPPS, you may prefer to choose one of the other 
							solutions available on the web.</p>
							<p>You will still be able to make use of all the examples 
							in this book, but you’ll have to follow the instructions 
							supplied with each WAMP, which may not be as easy to 
							follow as the preceding guide.</p>
							<p>Here’s a selection of some of the best alternatives, 
							in my opinion:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
								<p>
								<a href="http://easyphp.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
								EasyPHP</a></p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>
								<a href="http://apachefriends.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
								XAMPP</a></p>
								</li>
								<li>
								<p>
								<a href="https://wampserver.aviatechno.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
								WAMPServer</a></p>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<div class="note">
								<h4>Note</h4>
								<p>Over the life of this edition of the book, it 
								is very likely that the developers of AMPPS will 
								make improvements to the software, and therefore 
								the installation screens and method of use may evolve 
								over time, as may versions of Apache, PHP, or MySQL. 
								So, please don’t assume something is wrong if the 
								screens and operation look different. The AMPPS 
								developers take every care to ensure it is easy 
								to use, so just follow any prompts given, and refer 
								to the documentation on the

					<h1>Installing a LAMP on Linux</h1>
					<p>This book is aimed mostly at PC and Mac users, but its contents 
					will work equally well on a Linux computer. However, there are 
					dozens of popular flavors of Linux, and each of them may require 
					installing a LAMP in a slightly different way, so I can’t cover 
					them all in this book. However, there is a version of AMPPS 
					available for Linux, which is probably the simplest way for 
					you to go.</p>
					<p>That said, some Linux versions come preinstalled with a web 
					server and MySQL, and the chances are that you may already be 
					all set to go. To find out, try entering the following into 
					a browser and see whether you get a default document root web 
					page:</p>
					<div>
						<pre>
http://localhost</pre>
						<div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>If this works, you probably have the Apache server installed

					<p>If you have access to a web server already configured with

					your best option. Developing locally allows you to test modifications

					<p>Accessing MySQL remotely may not be easy either. You should 
					use the secure SSH protocol to log in to your server to manually

							easier to use especially if you’re a beginner.</p>
							<p>On a Mac, you already have SSH available as well. 
							Just select the <em>Applications</em> folder, followed

							<div>
								<pre>

								<div>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>where <em><code>server.com</code></em> is the name

							<h2>Transferring Files</h2>
							<p>To transfer files to and from your web server, you 
							will generally need a file transfer program that implements 
							an FTPS or SFTP protocol, to ensure proper security 
							on your web server. If you go searching the web for 
							a good client, you’ll find so many that it could take 
							you quite a while to come across one with all the right 
							features for you.</p>
							<div>
								<h1>Don’t Use FTP</h1>
								<p>FTP is insecure and should not be used. There 
								are far safer methods than FTP for transferring 
								files, such as SSH-based SFTP (SSH File Transfer 
								Protocol or Secure File Transfer Protocol) and SCP 
								(Secure Copy Protocol) are gaining traction. Good 
								FTP programs, however, will also support SFTP and 
								FTPS (FTP-SSL). Often the means of file transfer 
								you use will be down to the policies of the company 
								you work for, but for personal use an FTP program 
								such as FileZilla (discussed next) will provide 
								most (if not all) of the functionality and security 
								you require.</p>
							</div>
							<p>My preferred SFTP program is the open source
							<a href="http://filezilla-project.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
							FileZilla</a>, for Windows, Linux, and macOS 10.5 or 
							newer (see <a href="#filezilla-grab">Figure 2-10</a>). 
							Full instructions on how to use FileZilla are available 
							on the
							<a href="http://wiki.filezilla-project.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
							wiki</a>.</p>

							<p>Another well-known tool is
							<a href="https://winscp.net/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
							WinSCP</a> which, despite its name, also supports SFTP 
							and FTP. Of course, if you already have an FTPS or SFTP

					<h1>Using a Code Editor</h1>
					<p>Although a plain-text editor works for editing HTML, PHP, 
					and JavaScript, there have been some tremendous improvements 
					in dedicated code editors, which now incorporate very handy 
					features such as colored syntax highlighting. Today’s program 
					editors are smart and can show you where you have syntax errors 
					before you even run a program. Once you’ve used a modern editor, 
					you’ll wonder how you ever managed without one.</p>
					<p>There are a number of good programs available, but I have 
					settled on Visual Studio Code (VSC) from Microsoft because it’s 
					powerful; runs on all of Windows, Mac, and Linux; and is free 
					(see <a href="#program-editors-like-visual">Figure 2-11</a>). 
					It is also a comprehensive developing environment and is becoming 
					ever more standard in the industry.</p>

					<p>As you can see from
					<a href="#program-editors-like-visual">Figure 2-11</a>, VSC 
					highlights the syntax appropriately, using colors to help clarify 
					what’s going on. What’s more, you can place the cursor next 
					to brackets or braces, and it will highlight the matching ones 
					so that you can check whether you have too many or too few. 
					In fact, VSC does a lot more in addition, which you will discover 
					and enjoy as you use it. You can download a copy from the
					<a href="http://code.visualstudio.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">
					Visual Studio website</a>.</p>
					<p>Again, if you have a different preferred program editor, 
					use that; it’s always a good idea to use programs you’re already 
					familiar with, but I believe you will be hard pushed to find 
					something better than the now industry standard VSC, so you 
					should at least know how to use this product as many job positions 
					will require it.</p>
					<p>Having reached the end of this chapter you will now have 
					everything set up and installed ready to commence your journey 
					into mastering the various development technologies in this 
					book, beginning with a solid introduction to PHP in the following 
					chapter. But before you go, take a couple of minutes to answer 
					the questions below to ensure you have remembered the main points.</p>
